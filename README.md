# Search Jira Issues - Alfred 2 Workflow

![Workflow](screenshots/workflow.png)

This workflow for Alfred 2 allows you to search issues on an Atlassian Jira installation. The queries used are customizable to your needs.

## Dependencies

* [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
* `curl`
* ImageMagick (optional, see settings)

The easiest way to install the dependencies is [`brew`](http://brew.sh/):

```bash
$ brew install curl jq
```

## Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/swissmanu/search-jira-issues-alfred-workflow/releases) and open the `search.jira-issues.alfredworkflow` file to install it automatically to Alfred.

## Configuration
You have to create your own `config.json` file before you can use the new workflow:

1. Open your Alfred settings, select the `Workflows` tab
2. Right click the `Search JIRA Issues` workflow and select `Show in Finder`
3. Copy the `config.sample.json` file and rename it to `config.json`. Open the copied file in the text editor of your choice.
4. Modify the contained settings to your needs. Look below for further explanation of each setting.
5. Save `config.json` and you are ready to go.


### Available Settings

| Setting | Description | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `user`  | The username you use to login to JIRA. | `spongebob` |
| `password` | The password associated to the given username to login to JIRA. | `supersecret` |
| `jiraUrl` | The URL of your JIRA installation. Make sure you DON'T enter a trailing `/`. | `https://myjira.com` |
| `maxResults` | Limit the number of issues to display. | `20` |
| `emptySearchJql` | This JQL query is executed if you don't enter any search term after the workflows keyword. See [Atlassians JQL documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching) for available query options. | `project = 'FOO' ORDER BY lastViewed` |
| `searchJql` | This JQL query is executed if you enter a search term after the workflows keyword. Use `{query}` to pass the entered search term to JIRA's API. See [Atlassians JQL documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching) for available query options. | `project = 'FOO' summary~'{query}' ORDER BY lastViewed` |
| `convertImages` | Sometimes project icons are SVG images that can not be displayed in Alfred. Set this to true and make sure ImageMagick's `convert` is in your path. | `"convertImages": true` |

## Usage
Open your Alfred prompt and start typing `jira`. The workflow will call JIRA's API with the given `emptySearchJql` JQL query if you enter no specific search term.
As soon as you begin to type further, the `searchJql` JQL is used to fetch any matching issues.

* Select an issue to open it in your default browser
* Press `cmd` and select an issue copies the issues number to your clipboard
* Press `alt` and select an issue copy-pastes the issues number to the current application.


## Troubleshooting
If Alfred is not able to retrieve any issues following fixes might help you:

* Ensure that the `Script Filter` and all `Run Script` actions use your main shell as interpreter
* Check your `config.json` for invalid JSON and/or wrong values
